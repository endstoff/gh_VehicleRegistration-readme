## What does the script do

This is a script where players can registrate their vehicles on a set location. On registration, the Vehicle will be set at the database as registered and can be retrieved from the Police. To registrate a vehicle the player needs to drive to the registration office with a owned car and a configurable amount of money on his hand.
